# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Craig Albuquerque

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm a **Data Scientist** with a diverse background in **Machine Learning, Statistical Data Analytics, Business Impact Analysis,** and **Project Management**. I‚Äôm passionate about turning complex problems into actionable insights through data-driven solutions.

## üîß What I Do
I specialize in:
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Including Neural Networks, Time Series Forecasting, and Computer Vision.
- **Statistical Data Analytics**: A/B Testing, Hypothesis Testing, and Model Evaluation.
- **Data Management & Transformation**: Skilled in building end-to-end data pipelines and orchestrating data flows for clean, reliable datasets.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Proficient in NLP/NLU and Transformer models, such as BERT and OpenAI's GPT, for tasks like sentiment analysis and information extraction.
- **Data Visualization & Storytelling**: I love transforming complex datasets into intuitive visualizations using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Python visualization libraries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R, SQL, PySpark.
- **Machine Learning Tools**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Azure ML, AWS Redshift, CNNs.
- **Data Tools**: Advanced Excel Analytics, Tableau, Power BI, Google Analytics, and Data Studio.
- **Project Management**: GitHub, Jira, MS Project, Agile & Scrum methodologies.

## üåü Projects & Experience
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Developed a **CNN-based image classification system** to detect anomalies in machine data. Reduced unexpected downtime by 25%.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Built an NLP pipeline to classify incident tickets with 70% accuracy. Improved model performance by 15% through handling unstructured data.
- **Churn Prediction**: Created **Random Forest models** to predict customer churn behavior with 87% accuracy. Enabled proactive business interventions.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Applied ARIMA and LSTM models to forecast **gold export prices**. Demonstrated strong financial analytics skills.
- **Skin Cancer Detection**: Developed a **custom CNN** for skin cancer classification using TensorFlow. Achieved 80% accuracy in detecting melanoma versus benign lesions.
- **Hospital Stay Prediction**: Built a machine learning model to predict patient stay durations. Achieved 75% accuracy in classifying stays over 100 days, improving hospital resource planning.




## üå± What I‚Äôm Working On
I‚Äôm currently diving deeper into **Transformer-based architectures** for natural language understanding and exploring **MLOps** for seamless deployment of machine learning models.
